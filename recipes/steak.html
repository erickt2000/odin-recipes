    <h2>A juicy, succulent steak made with a quick and simple recipe!</h2>
    <p>With just a few ingredients, you too can cook a high quality steak from the comfort of your home with a technique known as pan-searing.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 (12-oz) New York strip or ribeye steaks or 4 (6-oz) filet mignons, about 1 1/2 inches thick</li>
        <li>1 heaping teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>A few sprigs fresh thyme leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Pat the steaks dry with paper towels</li>
        <li>Season the steaks with salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Turn on your exhaust fan and heat a heavy pan (such as cast iron or stainless steel) over medium-high heat until it is very hot!</li>
        <li>Add the oil to the pan and heat until it begins to shimmer and move fluidly around the pan</li>
        <li>Set the steaks in the pan carefully, making sure you are releasing them AWAY from you so the oil doesn't splatter in your direction, this will cause the oil to sizzle</li>
        <li>Leave the steaks alone for a couple of minutes in order to develop a golden crust</li>
        <li>Flip the steaks when they release easily off the pan and the bottom is a deep-brown color. This will take about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook the steaks for another 3 to 4 minutes on the second side for rare to medium-rare. (For medium, cook 4 to 5 minutes on second side; for well-done, cook 5 to 6 minutes on second side)</li>
        <li>During the last minute of cooking, add the butter and thyme sprigs to the pan</li>
        <li>IF serving the steaks unsliced, transfer them to plates and serve hot</li>
        <li>Otherwise, transfer them to a cutting board and let rest, covered with aluminum foil, for 5 to 10 minutes; then slice thinly against the grain</li>
    </ol>
