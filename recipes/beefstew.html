<h2>It's hard to pass on this meal on a cold winter's day!</h2>
<p>This classic stick-to-your-ribs stew is the ideal project for a chilly weekend. Beef, onion, carrots, potatoes and red wine come together in cozy harmony. If you are feeding a crowd, good news: It doubles (or triples) beautifully.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>3 pounds boneless chuck roast (cut into 2-inch pieces)</li>
    <li>1 to 2 teaspoons salt (or to taste)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 medium yellow onions (cut into 1-inch chunks)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 cup red wine</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
    <li>1 medium dried bay leaf</li>
    <li>3 cups beef broth (low sodium)</li>
    <li>3 large russet potatoes, peeled, cut into eights</li>
    <li>2 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch slices</li>
    <li>4 medium carrots, peeled, cut into 1-inch slices</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, garnish</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
    <li>On medium-high heat, add the vegetable oil to a large heavy pot (one that has a tight-fitting lid).</li>
    <li>When it begins to smoke slightly, add the beef and brown on all sides. Do so in batches if necessary. Add the salt and pepper as the beef browns.</li>
    <li>Once browned, remove the beef with a slotted spoon or tongs and set aside.</li>
    <li>Add the onions and saut√© for about 5 minutes, until softened.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and add the flour. Cook for 2 minutes stirring often. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Add wine and deglaze the pan, scraping any brown bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. The flour will start to thicken the wine as it comes to a simmer.</li>
    <li>Simmer the wine for 5 minutes and then add the beef, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf. Top with the broth. Bring back to a gentle simmer, cover, and cook on very low for about 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Add potatoes, celery, and carrots and simmer, covered, for another 30 minutes, or until the meat and vegetables are tender. Taste and adjust seasoning.</li>
    <li>Turn off the heat and let sit for 15 minutes before serving. Garnish with the fresh parsley if desired.</li>
</ol>
